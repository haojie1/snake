# Dependencies for Running
Only g++ and make are needed. SDL2, SDL2_Image and SDL2_TTF are included in this repo. So you don't need to download it any more. I think this will make life better for all beginners.  
Notes: SDL2, SDL2_Image and SDL2_TTF are suit for windows, so if you are using linux, you need to download the sdl2 library and override the contents of src directory.
